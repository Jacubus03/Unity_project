# Unity_project
VR Arcade Game

## Idea:
A VR arcade-style endless runner developed in Unity, where the player uses only a grappling hook or whip to swing between obstacles. The gameplay focuses on momentum-based movement and fast reflexes, requiring players to latch onto terrain elements to traverse an ever-changing environment.

## Required Assets (Not Included)

This project depends on the following Unity Asset Store packages:
- [The Red Prison](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/dungeons/the-red-prison-40198)
- [Altar_HellGate_BloodPool](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/altar-hellgate-bloodpool-101442)

Place packages folder in `Assets/Downloads/Unity`

## What Iâ€™m Learning:
1. Designing and implementing VR mechanics
2. Creating physics-based swinging and grappling systems
3. Learning different facets of game development
