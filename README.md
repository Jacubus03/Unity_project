VR Arcade Game

## Idea:
A VR arcade-style endless runner developed in Unity, where the player uses only a grappling hook or whip to swing between obstacles. The gameplay focuses on momentum-based movement and fast reflexes, requiring players to latch onto terrain elements to traverse an ever-changing environment.

## What Iâ€™m Learning:
1. Designing and implementing VR mechanics
2. Creating physics-based swinging and grappling systems
3. Learning different facets of game development
