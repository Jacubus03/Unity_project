# Unity_project
VR Arcade Game

## Idea:
A VR arcade-style endless runner developed in Unity, where the player uses only a grappling hook or whip to swing between obstacles. The gameplay focuses on momentum-based movement and fast reflexes, requiring players to latch onto terrain elements to traverse an ever-changing environment.

## Required Assets (Not Included)
